- @bigs
 - Done:
  - Wound up focusing on single node testing. JS & Go teams have collaborated to create [one suite](https://github.com/libp2p/interop) of interop tests. This will also go towards single node benchmarks.
  - Migrated to go.mod.
  - Met with Jim & Adin regarding dynamic data use cases for the testlab, got tentative sign on as first use cases.
 - Next:
  - libp2p instrumentation fest

- @vyzo
  - Done: 
    - relays with large yamux window: 2x faster
  - Next:
    - stress testing
    - latency based relay selection for autorelay
    - speed up autonat NAT detection time
    
- @jhiesey
  - Next:
    - Continue DHT redesign proposal
    
- @aschmahmann
  - Done:
    - Started work on a configurable PubSub to that supports persistence. This also allows IPNS-over-PubSub without requiring an initial DHT retrieval.
  - Next:
    - Investigate propagation of persistent graphs via a configurable gossipsub
    - Investigate testlab for the various IPNS experiments I'm interested in. May require some libp2p instrumentation first, but may also be able to get some useful metrics without it.
