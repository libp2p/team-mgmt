## Agenda

- Biweekly updates 
- jacob: question about go multistream-select.
  - During the connection upgrade, does go only perform the multistream handshake prior to crypto selection? JS currently does the handshake before crypto and muxer selection.
    - The multistream shake will occur before each. The dialer should send multistream and the desired protocol in a single packet. (Jake to add a PR to the spec to standardize this)

## Biweekly updates


- @jacobheun
  - Done:
    - interface-transport timeline, close and filter tests added [interface-transport#55](https://github.com/libp2p/interface-transport/pull/55)
      - Fixed bug in libp2p-tcp as a result of this [js-libp2p-tcp#113](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-tcp/pull/113)
    - Upgraded `bl` module to 4.0.0 across async refactor dependencies. `bl` < 4 can cause issues when there are different versions installed. 
    - interface-stream-muxer testing support for connection tracking [interface-stream-muxer#56](https://github.com/  libp2p/interface-stream-muxer/pull/56)
    - Async dial flow is working, just need to resolve a bug with multistream-select during the upgrade process
  - Next:
    - Fix issue with the async libp2p connection upgrade flow
