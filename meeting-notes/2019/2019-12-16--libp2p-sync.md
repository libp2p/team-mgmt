- @aschmahmann
   - Blocked:
      - Provider records using multihashes instead of CIDs (https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/pull/422)
        - Blocked from being merged awaiting consensus on what types of provider record keys DHT servers should allow (multihashes, multihashes + CIDs, anything, anything less than 80 bytes, etc.)
      - @raulk asked me to review [kad#383](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/pull/383). There are a few changes since he last saw it. Can we (@aarsh + I) just use our best judgment merge or should we wait for @raulk to review?
    - Next:
       - DHT query improvements (don't dial all nodes, and do disjoint dials)
