## Agenda

- Biweekly updates 
- WebRTC WG at W3C looking for DHT/p2p use cases for the June interim [js-libp2p-webrtc-star#177](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-webrtc-star/issues/177).
  - There is also a request to have someone from PL available to participate, to present the use cases and current problems. https://github.com/arewedistributedyet/arewedistributedyet/issues/22#issuecomment-492147188

## Biweekly updates

- @jacobheun
  - Done:
    - Identify Push support in libp2p:
      - Draft PR to Add identify push protocol in js-libp2p-identify [libp2p-identify#53](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-identify/pull/53)
      - Integration of new identify API into Switch [libp2p-switch#338](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-switch/pull/338)
        - Push support will be added later, once AutoNat is supported in js.
    - Worked on the demo nodejs and browser apps for IPFS Camp Course
  - Blocked:
  - Next:
    - IPFS Camp Course presentation and finish demo apps in js
    - Finish Identify Push integration
    - Start on AutoNat
      - Will produce a Spec for it as a part of this effort.
    - Go through infrastructure inventory of libp2p with Ops  

- @yusefnapora
  - Done:
    - Started connection establishment spec [draft pr](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/168)
    - [PR to update multistream-select README](https://github.com/multiformats/multistream-select/pull/17)
    - Went to Ethereum 2.0 "Road to interop" meetup
      - not really any hands-on / hack time. interesting presentations tho
      - Whiteblock has built a testing framework to measure gossipsub
        performance in various network topologies. So far have tested with a
        fixed 100 node count, but planning bigger tests soon. They haven't
        published results & want more people to play with it and help improve
        the framework.
            - https://github.com/Whiteblock/p2p-tests
      - most Eth2 clients are using libp2p or planning to
      - they might also try to define a simple wire protocol that doesn't use
        libp2p, just for interop testing eth-specific things between client
        implementations.
      - Vitalik presented about sharding eth state and a proposal to allow
        mulitple "execution environments" (which he called "threads") to be
        published to the Eth2 beacon chain as wasm modules. In this model, the
        consensus layer only applies to recording state roots for each epoch,
        and the thread acts as a transition function between states. I'm
        probably misremembering / misrepresenting it, but I thought it was a
        pretty interesting idea.
  - Next:
    - Merge [peer id spec pr](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/100)
    - Merge [SECIO spec pr](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/106)
    - Work on connection establishment / upgrade spec some more
    
    
- @mgoelzer:  (traveling - won't be on call)
  - Done:
    - thanks for all the #shipped ideas in #libp2p
    - progress with onboarding new LTCs
    - investigated Phantom Drift user testing plan with @raul
    - more clarity about who is responsible for what parts of meetups
  - Blocked:
    - nothing
  - Next:
    - onboarding/interviewing
    - next phase of security audit
    
- @aschmahmann
  - Done:
    - Was with IPLD and at DTN last week
    - PR for [moving discovery into pubsub](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/pull/184)
  - Blocked:
    - Need reviews on discovery PR
    - Need help figuring out next steps for [adding pubsub configurability to gossipsub]( https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/pull/171)
      - @raulk suggested we may want to combine this with a refactor of pubsub that allows developers to create new routers without forking go-libp2p-pubsub
       - See: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/issues/175#issuecomment-494066216
  - Next:
    - Figure out steps with blocked above
    - Create go-ipfs fork that utilizes pubsub configurability PR (#171) so people can experiment with faster IPNS

    
- @vyzo
  - resolve ghastly kernel memory build up
  - lock striping in the peerstore and connection manager
    - completely eliminated lock contention in relays
  - fix connection manager behaviour with a lot of peers
    - background trimming
    - fix connection-peer count mismatch
  - autorelay: more frequent relay advertisements
  - relay issue: yamux-vs-mplex
    - we can't keep up with the handshakes when using yamux
    - propose to make relays mplex only
    - want to ship mplex write coalescer in next ipfs release
  
- @bigs
  - Done:
    - Implemented in memory transport, got reviews
    - Recorded testlab demo
  - Next;
    - Iterate on self dialing
      - multiaddr support for /memory
      - update memory transport impl to not use muxers/upgraders
      - implement config options for libp2p host
      
- @jhiesey
  - Done:
    - Resource manager proposal: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/635
  - Blocked:
    - Need feedback on resource manager, particularly from @stebalien and @raulk
  - Next:
    - Flesh out more details on resource management (e.g. concrete API changes)
    - Talk to @vyzo about host/swarm refactor requirements

- @vasco-santos (not attending)
  - Done:
    - Initial version of `js-gossipsub` PR merged
      - [ChainSafe/gossipsub-js#15](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossipsub-js/pull/15)

      - [libp2p/interface-connection#29#issuecomment-491262150](https://github.com/libp2p/interface-connection/pull/29#issuecomment-491262150)
    - Data Terra Nemo
  - Blocked: N/A
  - Next:
  - get `interface-connection` PR with the new proposal ready for review
  - enable gossipsub interop tests and integration in `js-libp2p`
  - more async iterators work
