- @jacobheun
  - Done:
    - js-libp2p [0.26.1](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/releases/tag/v0.26.1) was released, and includes the core module consolidation updates 
    - Reviewed the js-libp2p-mplex refactor, there is a failing TCP test, once that is corrected it should be good to go.
    - Have a working POC of signaling over a relay working to establish a direct webrtc connection
      - Need to abstract this out and determine a path forward for the spec
  - Blocked: N/A
  - Next:
    - Support async/await work
      - Promisify `switch.dial` as this will be needed for conversion of some of the other modules, like kad-dht
    - Continue with signaling over relay work
    - Update deploy and logging of websocket-star server (there were some restart issues last week)
