- @bigs
  - Done:
    - testlab now supports dependencies between tasks and post deploy hooks (particularly useful for registering metadata like peer ids of nodes)
  - Next:
    - testlab video
    - collab with adin
    - transition to self dialing for sprint

- @vyzo
  - Done:
    - Relaygeddon, averted
      - zapped thoz bugz!
    - identify improvements
      - replace addrs
      - periodic identify push if our address set has changed
    - autorelay improvements
      - dynamic relay addr calculation
      - deal with addrsplosion in relay addrs
   - Next:
     - pubsub: improve validator pipeline
     - libp2p: sketch out internals v2 to gain consensus before the hacking begins

- @jhiesey
  - Done:
    - Preliminary design for graph-oriented switch; discussed with @stebalien
  - Blocked:
  - Next:
    - Continue discussion on graph switch with @stebalien and others
    - Preliminary implementation


- @raulk:
  - Done:
    - First pass at abstractions (go-libp2p-core).
      - have a look: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-core/tree/consolidate-skeleton
      - top level issue: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/602
    - Worked with Marten to get him ramped up to tackle MS 2.0.
    - Ethereum 2.0 call.
    - RFCs: 
      - peerstore v2: https://github.com/libp2p/specs/issues/164
      - dht provider backoff: https://github.com/libp2p/specs/issues/163
      - sqlite datastore: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/605
    - set up whiteblock audit of gossipsub.
  - Next:
    - dialer v2.
    - refine abstractions refactor -- hopefully get it merged.
    - general technical orchestration of things.

- @stebalien:
  - Done:
    - Fixed DHT provider perf issues
      - https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/pull/326
      - https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/pull/319
  - Next:
    - Figure out https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-swarm/issues/119
    - Resume work on https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/pull/291

- @mgoelzer
  - Done:
    - prep for sec audit + kickoff call
  - Blocked:
    - perf reviews:  a little slowed down due to sec audit.  Will still meet 4/3 holly by mid-week this week.
  - Next:
    - keep the sec auditors unblocked
    - devise plan for phase 2 of security audit
    - start searching for 2 new go-libp2p engineers we can onboard

- @aschmahmann
  - Done:
    - Benchmarking IPNS-over-PubSub (just local, not testlab yet)
      - It's predictably pretty fast once the mesh is established, but establishing the mesh requires discovery which is currently not particularly fast (i.e. DHT resolution latency). Would like to try integration with rendezvous next to test performance then.
    - Pushed update to configuration PR (https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/pull/171). Work still ongoing.
  - Next:
    - Tweak persistent pubsub to send state on Join event instead of waiting one heartbeat
    - Work with @bigs on testlab benchmarking
    - integrate rendezvous into IPNS-over-PubSub
  - Question/Advertisement
    - Could use a review on the persistent pubsub configuration to make sure I'm reasonably on base
    - Interested on people's thoughts on multiaddr based content routing https://github.com/libp2p/notes/issues/11
