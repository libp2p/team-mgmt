## Weekly updates

- @anacrolix: 
  - https://gist.github.com/anacrolix/95c505eab14ffc283fef932fc5817c54

  - Done:
    - [js-libp2p 0.25 released](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/releases/tag/v0.25.0)
      - Added auto dial to discovered peers [js-libp2p#349](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/349)
      - Switch emits separate events for connection tracking instead of just using the muxed events [libp2p-switch#328](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-switch/pull/328)

      - Added basic support for switch priority queues
  - Blocked:
  - Next:
    - Continue working on network performance of js-ipfs with DHT enabled
    - Start work on getting [js-libp2p-rendezvous](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-rendezvous) up to date with the latest spec.

- @jhiesey
  - Done:
    - explored existing swarm/host architecture in go-libp2p
    - initial ideas for common "swarm" structure for both messages and connections; we need a general abstraction for stateful protocols. This is a graph, where messages pass between nodes
  - Blocked:
    - none
  - Next:
    - shedule meeting(s) with @stebalien and @yusefnapora(?) to discuss streams/messages/state
    - talk to @vyzo to understand design constraints/goals for relay
    - also talk to @marten-seemann
    
- @marten-seemann:
  - Done:
    - worked on QUIC tracing and fixed a few pacing-related bugs (and merged the changes for the next IPFS 0.4.20)
    - worked with the key update design team in the QUIC WG
  - Next:
    - Multistream 2.0
    
- @bigs:
  - Done:
    - initial onboarding w/ adin for testlab, lots of code review!
  - Next:
    - ironing out UX kinks and a gateway problem in the testlab.

- @yusefnapora:
  - Done:
    - lots of readme updates :)
    - incremental progress on concept docs
  - Next:
    - more concept docs
  - Other:
    - I'm off Monday & Tuesday next week (April 22 & 23)

- @raulk:
  - Done:
    - a lot of perf reviews.
    - lock down OKRs.
    - remove gx.
    - sketch for peerstore persistence/seeding.
    - relaygeddon aftermath.
    - forum maintenance.
  - Next:
    - consolidate abstractions and core types into `go-libp2p-core`.
    - ethereum 2.0 and other calls with strategic projects.
    - company meetings.

## Notes

- @vasco-santos out on 19th (friday) - Public holiday in Portugal
- Lots of interest in viewing last week's meeting but ipfs not working - is it pinned?

- @anacrolix:
  - Exploring tracing in OpenCensus
  - Waiting for functional gauges
  - Testing IPFS daemons in Australia
  
- @mgoelzer
  
- @jhiesey:
 - Considering how to handle messages in addition to streams.  Stateless as possible, but need state some places (like encryption, sessions)
 - Are messages reliable or unreliable?  Generally intended to be unreliable, but considering both.  Marten suggested QUIC unreliable messages protocol.
 - Interplay of encryption with relays.  Steb suggests doing e2e encryption; also suggesting packet vs circuit relay (latter has some limitations).  Will discuss offline.
 
- @marten-seemann:
  - discussing generation of keys with QUIC WG
  - QUIC tracing demo:
    - originally sending packets in bunches; fixed to be smooth
    - demonstration of congestion control working properly
