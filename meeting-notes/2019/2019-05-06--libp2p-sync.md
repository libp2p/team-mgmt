@jacobheun
  - Done:
    - pull-mplex (pull stream based mplex muxer) is ready for js-ipfs
      - pull-mplex wasnt setting the channel name [pull-mplex#12](https://github.com/libp2p/pull-mplex/pull/12)
      - Cleaned up the ipfs/interop pubsub tests and fixed an issue causing it to fail, [interop#66](https://github.com/ipfs/interop/pull/66). This also fixes the last thing needed to unblock [pull-mplex in js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1884).
    - Added message signing in js pubsub.
      - https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-pubsub/pull/17
      - https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-floodsub/pull/78
      - https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/362
    - Did some cpu testing of the dht on js-ipfs, need to finish that up this week
  - Blocked:
    - pubsub review and release from @vasco-santos
  - Next:
    - Get message signing released for pubsub
    - Add signature verification to pubsub [js-libp2p-pubsub#16](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-pubsub/issues/16)
    - Finish DHT performance testing on js-ipfs
    - Possibly start js-libp2p Nat Traversal and better address announcing  

@yusefnapora:
  - Done:
    - Started making work plan for improving libp2p specs: [gdocs link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R9PeTcdtU6Eaw42HL8QFL9padWnl1pPsDKz2TXLf9p4/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Progress on [godocs for go-libp2p-core](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-core/pull/3)
  - Next:
    - Review & prioritize specs work plan (input is appreciated!)
    - Start working on highest priority spec writing tasks
    - Improve README for multistream-select

@vyzo
  - Done:
    - daemon
      - fix shutdown crash bug
    - pubsub:
      - strict message signing
      - rework validator pipeline (open pr)
    - secio
      - fix ancient bug causing panic in mplex
    - connman
      - upsert interface method
    - relay
      - deadline in handshake
      - experiment with mplex only relay
        - why: throughput
        - so many connections!
          - memory usage quickly builds up from the millions of goroutines
          - add hard limit for relay goroutines in relay code (open pr)
        - surfaced couple of bugs in mplex:
          - log spam from remote triggered error; filled the log!
          - stream leak
        - the garbage collector is see-sawing and killing throughput
        - debugging mysterious kernel runaway memory build up
  - Next
    - debug the mplex-only relay; want to deploy all relays as mplex-only
    - autorelay: use relays known by passive discovery
    - design for the grand host/service refactoring

@bigs
  - Done:
    - Testlab to usable functionality status for distributed benchmarks. Actually!
  - Callout:
    - If you need something measured, get in touch so we can get it on my roadmap.
  - Next:
    - [Self dialing](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/328#issuecomment-465264415)
    - Testlab interviews


@aschmahmann
 - Done
  - LWW pubsub initial resolution is faster (on localhost is 50-100 ms + finding peer)
  - PubSubValueRouter improvements
    - initialization no longer waits on bootrapping over DHT publish (just for retrieve)
      - https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub-router/pull/29
    - Subscribe before Publish - needed for CLI users of LWW pubsub
      - https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub-router/pull/30
 - Next
  - Working on moving bootstrapping logic from [go-libp2p-pubsub-router](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub-router/) into [go-libp2p-pubsub](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/) by utilizing [go-libp2p-discovery](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-discovery/)
    - Some details [here](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub-router/issues/28)
- After this will work on a discovery wrapper for [rendezvous](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-rendezvous/pull/1)
- Going to rewrite https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/pull/171 to use channels (so it's consistent with the rest of pubsub)

@raulk:
  - Done:
    - dialer v2 iteration 2 done; submitting PR today.
      - interfaces: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-swarm/blob/feat/dialerv2-it2/dial/interfaces.go
      - comparison: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-swarm/compare/feat/dialerv2-it2?expand=1
    - debugging frenzy with vyzo
    - ethereum call 2.0; new implementer calls; more calls
    - connection manager: support early tagging: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-connmgr/pull/39
  - Next:
    - finish dialer v2
    - finish core refactor
    - review pubsub async validators
    - prepare Data Terra Nemo talk for next week
    - present {Phantom}Drift to the team
