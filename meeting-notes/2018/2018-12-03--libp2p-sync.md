## Agenda

- Biweekly updates 
- Travel Reminder (January Hack Week)
- Schedule a sync meeting for service architecture
  - Wed 5pm UTC
- RPC/actors
  - RPC / message passing is an ultra-common pattern, we should have x-language support.
  - [An issue discussing this matter](https://github.com/libp2p/libp2p/issues/23) - Let's keep the discussion going here.
  - We have an opportunity to do some deeper thinking about how we handle this. In a p2p environment where anyone can run any version of the software, it'd be nice to be able to register handlers for RPCs/messages identified in some sort of signed/content-addressed manner (perhaps on schema?)
- libp2p Community Calendar?

- @aschmahmann
  - Some questions:
     - Go-JS interoperable RPC library. Should we have one? https://github.com/libp2p/libp2p/issues/23
     - Encryption interfaces?
       - every so often someone posts a question asking about our interfaces only exposing signing and verifying, but not encryption
       - given that the identity group will end up giving us keys we may want to think about the internal key management and interfaces
