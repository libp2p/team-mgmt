* Choosing relay
    * use xor metric?

* With autonat telling that we are reachable and not being able to reach a peer directly, we could tell the other peer our public addrs with a relay connect message
    * should the address list be signed/authorized in some way?
* Extend indentify protocol to have protocol-specific metadata
* Don't act as a relay relay when autonat says we won't help
