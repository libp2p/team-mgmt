- @jacobheun
  - Done:
    - Fixed an issue with js-libp2p-switch not tracking connections properly. [libp2p-switch#318](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-switch/pull/318) This should help Connection Mananger do its job.
    - Improved how blacklisting is handled in js-libp2p-switch [libp2p-switch#319](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-switch/pull/319)
    - Fixed issues with js-libp2p-switch not stopping properly [libp2p-switch#324](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-switch/pull/324)
    - PeerBook puts are happening too much. Removed some of the unneeded ones in js-libp2p. [js-libp2p#348](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/348)
    - RFC and POC for js-libp2p auto dial support for discovered peers [js-libp2p#349](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/349)
    - Q2 OKR planning
  - Blocked:
  - Next:
    - Work on finishing up the libp2p auto dial support
    - Work on network performance of js-ipfs with dht enabled

- @vasco-santos

  - Done:
    - libp2p visualization tool MVP support
    - initial implementation of the `libp2p-introspection` with `switch` data
      - [vasco-santos/js-libp2p-introspection#2](https://github.com/vasco-santos/js-libp2p-introspection/pull/2)
    - Q2 OKR planning
    - Several reviews in the context of enabling the new release of `js-libp2p` and `js-ipfs`
  - Blocked: N/A
  - Next:
    - add streams data to `libp2p-introspection`
    - libp2p interop tests
      - streams interop tests review
    - async iterators migration
      - `interface-transport` and `interface-connection`
    - new iteration on `js-gossipsub`


- @vyzo
  - autonat/autorelay optimizations
    - cut down dialback timeout to 15s
    - parallelize dialbacks
    - autorelay time to advertise should be around 40-45s now instead of minutes
  - relaygeddon
    - relays getting overloaded and OOMing
    - deployed bigger (and more) relays
    - reduced memory footprint by tweaking io copy buffers
    - stability evaluation still in progress
    
- @yusefnapora:
  - Done:
    - merged initial [stream muxing concept doc](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/stream-multiplexing/)
    - helped launch https://discuss.libp2p.io
    - outlined concept doc for protocols (defining & using, multiplexing, negotiation, etc)
  - Next:
    - finish 1st draft of protocol concept doc
    - begin work on go-libp2p-examples to integrate into docs site 
    
- @jhiesey:
  - Done:
    - read Vuvuzela paper: https://vuvuzela.io/static/vuvuzela.pdf
    - investigated potential api changes in go-libp2p
  - Blocked:
  - Next:
    - write preliminary spec for messages
    - implement first experimental changes
    
- @bigs:
  - Done: 
    - Testlab OKRs
    - Daemon configuration updates with @mvid
    - Service discovery improvements for nomad/consul in the testlab.
    - Single node automation for testlab clusters
    - Super basic instrumentation of pubsub
  - Questions:
    - Selectively enable metrics per module a la logging?
  - Next:
    - Collab w/ Adin
    - Finish basic pubsub scenario   
  
- @aschmahmann:
  - Done:
    - Submitted WIP PR to go-libp2p-pubsub https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/pull/171
      - Enables some configurability to pubsub routers and subscription channels
      - There's a persistent Last-Writer-Wins configuration
      - @vyzo and @bigs, would appreciate your feedback as well as anyone else who is interested
     - There's also a DAG synchronization over gossipsub implementation tentatively in https://github.com/aschmahmann/ipshare based off the configurable gossipsub.
       - Should demonstrate user space configurability and won't increase dependencies in libp2p
  - Blocked:
  - Next:
    - Work with @bigs and @pgte on benchmarking the modified pubsub/IPNS
    - Follow up from pubsub WIP PR. Need feedback to do the follow up on though :). Thx for your help so far.
  - Question:
    - go-IPFS wants IPNS to have <1 second resolution, but decentralized peerID resolution can end up taking more than 1 second. They are asking for a pseudo-centralized solution in the meanwhile. They are thinking of using something like DNS, but would it be sufficient to use rendezvous or small namespaced DHTs?
      - probably no time for this now, but feel free to reach out over Slack (there's an IPNS channel) or IRC (the #ipfs-dynamic-data channel for now, but there will probably be an ipns channel soon)

@raulk:
  - Done:
    - Q2 2019 OKR.
    - second week of libp2p visualiser design sprint: finished! will present results soon.
    - drafting introspection protocol.
    - drafting connmgr v2 spec.
    - launched discuss.libp2p.io!
    - debugged relays with vyzo.
  - Blocked:
    - N/A.
  - Next:
    - finish connmgr v2 spec.
    - present libp2p network visualiser mockups to the team.
    - performance reviews.
    - consolidate interfaces under go-libp2p-abstract \o/
