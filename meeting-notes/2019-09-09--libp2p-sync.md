    - Got Dominic from Least Authority for sec audit of gossipsub protocol
    - Got libp2p final sec audit booted up (starts tomorrow!)

    - Got phantom drift implementation stage up and running (starts today, through to December)
    - Engaged chris remus to help recruit and screen for proj mgr role
   - Blocked

  - Done:
    - Merged fetch spec [libp2p/specs#204](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/204)
    - Two libp2p discovery utility PRs out
      - Backoff + Caching: [libp2p/go-libp2p-discovery#26](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-discovery/pull/26)
      - Discovery <-> Content routing [libp2p/go-libp2p-discovery#27](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-discovery/pull/27)
  - Next:
    - Work with reviewers (@bigs) on discovery PRs
    - Update go-libp2p-pubsub discovery PR [libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub#184](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/pull/184) to use pubsub events, and test with discovery utilities
      
- @jacobheun
  - Done:
    - js-multiaddr will now use `/p2p` instead of `/ipfs` by default [js-multiaddr#97](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiaddr/pull/97)
    - async/await refactor
      - Adding an `Upgrader` to the Switch to pass to transports, similar to how go behaves. So far the local refactor is greatly simplifying the dialing logic.
  - Blocked:
  - Next:
    - Update js-multistream-select to protocol selection along with the multistream protocol to fix [an issue with rust interop](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1241#issuecomment-529529989)
    - libp2p async iterators

    - Message-orientation proposal (alpha). Will be circulating this today.
    - DHT code review.
    - Initial experiments with pions/dtls (golang dtls implementation) -- @raulk: gonna hit you up on this. Noise with inlined keys + IK handshake could help here.
  - Next:
    - Complete message-orientation security survey, update report.
    - Finalize first action step for message orientation
    - DHT code review
    - go-libp2p-discovery review
