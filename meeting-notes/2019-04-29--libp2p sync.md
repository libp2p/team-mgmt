  - Done:
    - JS Switch will no longer add observed addresses until we start doing proper validation [js-libp2p-switch#337](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-switch/pull/337)
   - Fixed an issue retrieving peerinfo in the js-libp2p daemon [js-libp2p-daemon#17](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-daemon/pull/17)
   - JS DHT Performance work [js-libp2p-kad-dht#107](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-kad-dht/pull/107)
     - Added timeouts to lower the impact of slow/offline peers
     - Following S/Kademlia and starting with k (20) peers instead of alpha (3)
     - Created a basic simulation to be able to compare new changes against
     - Reduction in query times from upwards of 10minutes, to under 1 minute
     - Network latency improvements via NAT traversal and more controlled dial timeouts should help with further query time improvements
