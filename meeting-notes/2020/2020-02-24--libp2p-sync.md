## Agenda

- Weekly updates 
- Peerstore: address provenances.
  - Signed peer records will cause unsigned records to be removed
    - If a user provides an address to dial, this can cause problems
  - By default the dialer will use every address in the peer store
  - Add support for options by dial to specify the address provenance type
  - @yusefnapora to create a design issue to further discuss this
- Peerstore: refcounted pinning.
  - When a peer disconnects we set a TTL of 10 minutes for those addresses
  - How can we ensure addresses are not disappearing for "good" addresses?
    - What do we do to guard against bad subsystems that pin addresses?
    - [WIP Conn Manager v2 spec](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/161)
  - [WIP Peerstore v2 spec](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/issues/164)
- A way for swarm to understand which transport are better ?
  - How do we handle dial backoff when dials to higher priority transports take longer?
    - Return the connection of the fastest connection, and also yield successful higher priority transport connections that return within the dial timeout
      - Need to implement stream convergence where we prioritize the desired connection
      - Create a callback (alternative connection open, or similar) so that the application layer can handle this
  - The [swarm pipeline PR](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-swarm/pull/122) needs to be landed to help improve the layers of abstraction currently in the swarm. It won't solve this problem, but it should make this easier to implement.      
    

## Weekly updates
  
- @jacobheun
  - Done:
    - Fixed an issue with libp2p-tcp throwing uncaught errors in the listener [libp2p-tcp#122](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-tcp/pull/122)
    - local [interop testing](https://github.com/libp2p/interop/pull/32) for go and js libp2p noise is passing for XX handshakes
      - Need to verify IK and XX fallback
    - Started planning out Content Routing work through June
  - Next:
    - Golang training
    - Catch up on blocking PR Reviews
      - js-libp2p-stardust
      - js-ipfs-bitswap
    - Finish noise implementation evaluation against spec for go & js
    - Design of multiaddr resolver usage in js-libp2p  

- @raulk
  - Done:
    - IPFS team week last week.
  - Next:
    - Securing gossipsub initiative.
    - Shipping the testground v0.2 release; planning testground v0.3.
    - Support Yusef to land go-libp2p-noise.
    - Support Yusef to design + land "address provenance" attributes to peerstore; outstanding item to merge a well-rounded version of signed peer records.
    - Will's AutoNAT PRs.
    - Aarsh's peerstore persistence PR and routing table dissociation PR.


- @yusefnapora
  - Done:
    - [Security Considerations article for docs site](https://github.com/libp2p/docs/pull/79)
    - lots of tail-chasing thinking about peerstore APIs, trying to figure out Noise Pipes problem (issues incoming soon)
  - Next:
    - peerstore work / finish up peer records
    - distributed systems in Go curriculum


- @Jorropo:
  - Done:
    - Starting an "ultimate" (it just work, no need of external server) [webrtc aside](https://github.com/Jorropo/go-webrtc-aside-transport).
  - Next:
    - Investigating swarm deadlock when calling Newstream on the same peer if the goroutine is been invoked from swarm.DialPeer. (https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-swarm/issues/161)
    - DHT STUN server findings (finding some libp2p nodes running a stun server in the dht).
