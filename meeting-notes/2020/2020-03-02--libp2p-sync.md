- @yusefnapora
  - Done:
    - [decided](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/issues/249) to remove Noise
      Pipes from noise spec / implementation
    - made [PR to remove pipes from
      go-libp2p-noise](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-noise/pull/53)

    - finish editing Noise spec to remove Pipes & push spec PR
    - finish designing & implement address provenance in peerstore
    - make PR to go-ipfs to optionally enable noise

- @aschmahmann
  - Done:
    - LAN/VPN DHT discussions with @stebalien. Have an action plan that is underway (https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/803)
    - Went over short-term DHT improvements with @daviddias, more this week
  - Ongoing:
    - Move relevant DHT changes from stabilize go-libp2p-kad-dht branches (and the efficient query branch) into new branches based off of master
      - While doing this have been tackling https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/803
      - done branches include:
         - cypress = master + query logic
         - feat/mode-switching = cypress + mode switching (client + server)
         - feat/rt-identify = cypress + using the eventbus instead of Notifiee
      - in progress:
         - feat/peer-filtering = cypress + optional filtration of peers we query and peers we place in our routing tables
         - Miscellanea: There seem to have been some random PRs that went into stabilize and not master (e.g. metrics, test fixes, etc.) I was probably going to bundle these up.
  - Next:
    - DHT upgrade path (https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/780)
    - Rework testground tests to take into account new DHT changes

- @raulk:
  - Done:
    - Shipped testground v0.2: https://github.com/ipfs/testground/releases/tag/v0.2.0
    - Worked on address provenance modelling on the peerstore (PR incoming, paired with @yusefnapora).
    - Simplified the Noise handshake to XX only (@yusefnapora, @stebalien).
    - Securing gossipsub taskforce.
    - GitHub issue migration follow-ups (apparently it's fixed!).
  - Blocked:
  - Next:
    - THIS IS A CODE-INTENSIVE WEEK FOR ME.
    - Hardcore sprint on testground + DHT test plan + debugging.
