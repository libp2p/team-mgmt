## Weekly updates

- @anacrolix: 
  - https://gist.github.com/anacrolix/95c505eab14ffc283fef932fc5817c54
  - May have connection difficulties: Power outage and poor mobile coverage.

- @jacobheun (not attending)
  - Done:
    - [js-libp2p 0.25 released](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/releases/tag/v0.25.0)
      - Added auto dial to discovered peers [js-libp2p#349](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/349)
      - Switch emits separate events for connection tracking instead of just using the muxed events [libp2p-switch#328](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-switch/pull/328)
        - Connection Manager uses the new events [connection-manager#19](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-connection-manager/pull/19)
      - Fix issue with switch not being configurable [libp2p#354](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/354)
      - Added basic support for switch priority queues
  - Blocked:
  - Next:
    - Continue working on network performance of js-ipfs with DHT enabled
    - Start work on getting [js-libp2p-rendezvous](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-rendezvous) up to date with the latest spec.  

- @mgoelzer:
  - Done:
    - Perf reviews
  - Blocked:
    - none
  - Next:
    - Perf review summaries
    - go-libp2p security audit

- @vasco-santos (not attending)
  - Done:
    - refactor of the `libp2p-introspection` current code and some new data added
      - [vasco-santos/js-libp2p-introspection#2](https://github.com/vasco-santos/js-libp2p-introspection/pull/2)
    - new review on `js-gossipsub` PR
      - [ChainSafe/gossipsub-js#15](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossipsub-js/pull/15)
    - looked at @dirkmc PR for async/await interface-transport
      - [libp2p/interface-transport#44](https://github.com/libp2p/interface-transport/pull/44)
    - a lot of maintenance work
      - debugging for `js-ipfs` release
        - [ipfs/js-ipfs#1988](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1988)
        - [ipfs/interop#61](https://github.com/ipfs/interop/pull/61)
        - [ipfs/interop#62](https://github.com/ipfs/interop/pull/62)
      - adding discuss.libp2p.io badges and updating dependencies of all js libp2p modules (22/~50)
        - [libp2p/libp2p#74](https://github.com/libp2p/libp2p/issues/74)
  - Blocked: N/A
  - Next:
   - async iterators migration
      - proposal for `interface-connection`
   - debug publish issue on `js-gossipsub`
   - finish updating all JS libp2p modules
   - libp2p interop tests
    - streams interop tests review
    
- @jhiesey
  - Done:
    - explored existing swarm/host architecture in go-libp2p
    - initial ideas for common "swarm" structure for both messages and connections; we need a general abstraction for stateful protocols. This is a graph, where messages pass between nodes
  - Blocked:
    - none
  - Next:
    - shedule meeting(s) with @stebalien and @yusefnapora(?) to discuss streams/messages/state
    - talk to @vyzo to understand design constraints/goals for relay
    - also talk to @marten-seemann
    
@marten-seemann:
  - Done:
    - worked on QUIC tracing and fixed a few pacing-related bugs (and merged the changes for the next IPFS 0.4.20)
    - worked with the key update design team in the QUIC WG
  - Next:
    - Multistream 2.0
    

## Notes

- @vasco-santos out on 19th (friday) - Public holiday in Portugal
- Lots of interest in viewing last week's meeting but ipfs not working - is it pinned?

- @anacrolix:
  - Exploring tracing in OpenCensus
  - Waiting for functional gauges
  - Testing IPFS daemons in Australia
  
- @mgoelzer
  
- @jhiesey:
 - Considering how to handle messages in addition to streams.  Stateless as possible, but need state some places (like encryption, sessions)
 - Are messages reliable or unreliable?  Generally intended to be unreliable, but considering both.  Marten suggested QUIC unreliable messages protocol.
 - Interplay of encryption with relays.  Steb suggests doing e2e encryption; also suggesting packet vs circuit relay (latter has some limitations).  Will discuss offline.
 
- @marten-seemann:
  - discussing generation of keys with QUIC WG
  - QUIC tracing demo:
    - originally sending packets in bunches; fixed to be smooth
    - demonstration of congestion control working properly
